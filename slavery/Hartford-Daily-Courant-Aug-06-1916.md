### "THE OPTIMIST"<br>FREE NEGRO SLAVEOWNERS IN OLD VIRGINIA

BY REV. DR. EDWIN POND PARKER.

An interesting article in the July number of "The Journal of Negro History" brings to light one of the peculiarities of negro slavery as it formerly existed in Virginia, which was new to the Optimist and which, it is safe to say, will be new to most of our readers; namely, the legal right of free negroes in Virginia to own negro slaves.

In the second volume of Hening's Statutes at Large of Virginia (1670) the following enactment appears:—

> "No negro or Indian, though baptized and enjoyed their own freedom, shall be capable of any purchase of Christians, but yet not debarred from buying any of their own nation."

The words "Christians" in this act obviously means persons of the white race. A revision of this act seventy-eight years later retained the prohibition and annexed the provision that if any free negro or mulato "shall nevertheless presume to purchase a Christian white servant, such servant shall immediately become free." This act and its revised form would seem to indicate that colored freemen had attempted to purchase and hold white persons as slaves, but however that may have been, this admission in the written law of the right of free negroes to own slaves of their own race is prima facie evidence that there were colored freemen in Virginia who exercised that right.

But the records of the County Court of Northampton contain the case of the free negro Anthony Johnson and his negro slave John Casor. Anthony Johnson and his wife Mary were in Virginia as early as 1622. He was a respected man of wealth, to whom the state made a large grant of land in Northampton County.

The manuscript records of the County Court contain the deposition of Captain Samuel Goldsmyth (March 8, 1654), the substance of which is that a negro called John Casor complained to him that Anthony Johnson was forcibly and wrongfully holding him in servitude. Casor claimed that he had come into Johnson's service for seven years of indenture, and that the term of his service had long ago ended. Johnson said he knew nothing of any indenture and that he had the negro for his life.

Johnson decided to carry the case to the county court, to decide whether John Casor was a slave for life or a servant for seven years of indenture.

The court record of the suit is too long for quotation here, but it shows that the court rebuked certain parties who had abetted and harbored Casor, and ordered that "ye sd. Jno. Casor, negro, shall forthwith be returned into ye service of his sd. master Anthony Johnson." In thus upholding Johnson's claim to the perpetual service of Casor, the court gave judicial sanction to the right of free negroes to own slaves of their own race.

It is said that no earlier record has been found of judicial support given to slavery in Virginia except as a punishment for crime. This case of John Casor was doubtless somewhat peculiar, and yet the judgement in the case and the enactments already cited indicate that it was neither singular nor exceptional. That it was not a "freak of the seventeenth century" appears from the fact that long after slavery had become a settled and regulated institution, and even after Colonial days, slave-owning by free negroes was so common as to pass without criticism or notice by those who recorded events of the time. The proof of this is found in court records, legislative petitions, deeds of sale and transfer of slaves to free negroes, wills of colored freemen providing for the disposition of slaves, and records of suits for freedom against black masters.

Here is a record of the court of Henrico Country under date of 1795, and an example of what may be found in the records of any of the older countries of Virginia:—

<blockquote>Know all men by these presents that I, James Radford of the county of Henrico for and in consideration of the sum of thirty three pounds current money of Virginia to me in hand paid by George Radford a black freeman of the city of Richmond hath bargained and sold unto George Radford one negro woman Aggy, to have and to hold the said negro slave Aggy unto the said George Radford his heirs and assigns forever.

</blockquote>

Judith Angus, a well-to-do negress of Petersburg (1832) was the owner of two household slaves.

Sarah, a slave of a free negro woman, brought a suit for freedom, but no claim was made by the plaintiff that a black woman had no right to own a slave.

Reuben West, a free colored barber of some wealth in Richmond was the owner of slaves, one of whom worked in his master's shop.

Phil Cooper, of Gloucester County, in 1828 was the chattel slave of his free wife. In 1801 John Sahib of Richmond bought his aged father-in-law and for the nominal consideration of five shillings executed a deed of manumission.

The husband of Betsey Fuller, who was a free negress, was her slave.

Up to the year 1806 purchases by free negroes of relatives and friends followed by their manumission were frequently made. This open door to liberty aroused the vigilant slaveholders, and in 1806 a law was passed requiring any slave so manumitted to leave the state within the space of twelve months, and this law remained in force until the war rendered it obsolete. Then the free negroes continued to buy their relatives, but held them in "benevolent servitude," so evading the law of banishment. In such cases the negro holder of slaves ran the risk, at his death, of having his family sold like other property belonging to his estate.

Efforts to limit the power of free negroes to acquire slaves for profit were made by the legislature many years before the war. By an act of 1832 free negroes were declared incapable of buying or otherwise acquiring permanent ownership except by descent, of any slaves other than husband, wife or children, and contracts for the sale of a slave to a black man was to be regarded as void. This act of limitation was passed by a bare majority of one. Three years before the war this law was revised to read: "No free negro shall be capable of acquiring, except by descent, any slave."

The purpose of this law was to keep slaves as far as possible under the control of white men only, and to prevent free negroes from holding persons of their own race in servitude to themselves.

The records show, however, that the period of the existence of the free negro slaveholder was coterminous with the period of the existence of slavery—that is, in Virginia. Whether similar conditions existed in other southern colonies and states, our author does not say. "The same immortal proclamation which broke the shackles of slaves serving white masters, also rent asunder the bonds which held slaves to masters of their own race and color."

We have given a summary of the article by John H. Russell, Ph. D., professor of political science in Whitman College, Walla Walla, Washington. The numerous cases which he cites and describes are verified by footnote references to the records of courts and to other authorities.

It is of interest to know that while some negro slaveowners held their slaves merely for their service, and had great difficulty in controlling them, other black masters, and the most of them, held their fellows almost wholly in kindly consideration of them, and with a view of mitigating their servitude or of freeing them from it. Until 1806 the Virginia slaveholders possessed unrestricted powers to confer freedom upon their slaves. Free negroes frequently procured freedom for their enslaved kinsmen or friends by buying and then liberating them. Dr. Russell gives several deeds of sale as striking examples of such purchase and liberation. Peter Hawkins, a free negro of Richmond, bought his slave wife, Rose, and their little child Mary, and the record runs, "for the love I bear toward my wife and child, and for the further consideration of five shillings to me in hand paid, I emancipate and set free the said Rose and Mary, and relinquish all my right to the said Rose and Mary, as slaves."

Dr. Russell well says of a majority of the black slaveowners, that they were "the most benevolent known to history." In the dark history of slavery, there is no brighter feature than this frequent purchase of slave relations and friends by free negroes, not for personal profit but for the purpose of emancipation. The black freeman would pay for a relative or friend the master's full-price, often hundreds of dollars, then liberate him or her, either trusting the emancipated one to refund the price of freedom, or virtually giving the liberty for a nominal sum of a few shillings.

All this seems to us very noble in those black men, and well worth remembering to their credit. The later drastic regulation by the state, limiting this power of emancipation, and compelling slaves so liberated to quit their homes and the state, seems black as compared with the white of the negro's aims and endeavors for the liberation of his unfortunate fellows.
